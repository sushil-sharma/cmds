Git in a nutshell 
The high level of Git workflow 
	• You clone the repository to your local machine 
	• You branch off of an origin branch (like master or LKG) 
	• You work in a branch 
	• You commit locally 
	• You push commits to the remote 
	• You pull your commits into your origin branch (master or LKG) 
	• (Through merge or pull request) 
 Git repositories look like a tree 
	• Branches diverge and merge back in (most of the time) 
	• Each branch has a unique history of commits (changes) 
Git uses merges 
	• A merge is a joining of two branch histories 
	• Some merges are squashed 
Git Commits are the backbone of git
