 ls -la

make changes
add change
all files
git add .
specific file
git add file.txt

commit change
git commit -m "initital commit"
[master (root-commit) 4ca38ca] initital commit
 1 file changed, 24 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 git_cmds.txt
 
 after modifying file can add it to staging tree and also commit at same time
 will commit all modified files
 git commit -am "satged and committed"
 
 git log
 
 limit number of commits to list
 git log -n 2
 git log --since=2018-05-06
 git log --until=2018-05-06
 git log --author="Sushil"
 git log --grep "init"
 
print working dir
pwd

status between working dir, staging and repo trees
git status

changes
git diff
git diff filename.txt

changes between staged and repo
git diff --staged

delete file from repo after deleting from working dir
git rm filename.txt
running git rm filename.txt before deleting it from explorer will hard delete it and also delete from staging area
commit to repo
git commit -m "deleted files"

renaming or files
can do from explorer and then git add or let git handle
rename and move are same
git mv firstfile.txt secondfile.txt

undo changes from working dir from repo - wrong change in editor
git checkout -- filename.txt
-- tells git to use current branch

undo change from staging area
this is done after git commit when want to unstage a file. file in working dir remains same
git reset HEAD filename.txt

undo change committed - from repo
last commit can easily be ammended
commit will still be there - just modified (ammended)
gir commit --amend -m "any msg"

to undo changes to an older commit have to make new commit
git checkout 12345 -- filename.txt
12345 : sha of PREVIOUS commit which had the good file
check's out the file from commit with sha 12345 and adds it to staging area
git commit -m "undo commit 12345"
reverts change from commit 12345

can undo change of any commit in one step
git revert 98765
98765: part of sha of commit to revert
makes new commit which reverts changes of commit with sha 98765


undo multiple commits - dangerous
git reset
--soft
does not change staging	index or working dir
--mixed (default)
changes staging index to match repo
does not change working dir
--hard
changes staging index and working dir to match repo

git reset --soft 12121
12121 : sha of any previous commit

Removing untracked files - unnecessary files in working dir not part of project and not added
git clean
-n : test
-f : clean it
git clean -f
does not delete files which are staged or committed
hard delete

.gitignore
file with list of file one per line
wildcard also work
ignore all *.log files except main.log
*.log
!main.log
ingnore all files in subfolder2 with trailing slash
/subfolder/subfolder2/
regex
* ? [aeiou] [0-9]
comments
#this is a comment
.gitignore file itself has to be added and commited to repo
git commit -am "adding .gitignore"

global ignore
not stored in any repo
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
save it in user dir ~

tell git to ignore changes to a tracked file - already committed in repo
can do
git rm filename.txt
but this will also delete file from working dir
best way
add filename to .gitignore
git rm --cached filename.txt
git commit -m "removed filename from staging index"
what this does is removes file from index so changes are not tracked
actual file is still available in repo and working dir

empty folders are not tracked or committed
to track add an empty file to folders
.gitignore or .gitkeep

referencing commits
reference parent
HEAD^ or 12345^ or master^
^ means parent of this commit
grandparent
HEAD^^
how many levels up
HEAD~1 , HEAD~2


list of files in repo
git ls-tree HEAD
git ls-tree master
git ls-tree master subfolder/
git ls-tree master^ subfolder/
tree: dir
blob: file

get more details from git log
list each commit in compact list
git log --oneline
only 2 commits
git log --oneline -2
git log --since="2018-05-07"
can use after instead of since and before instead of until
git log --since="2 weeks ago" --until "3 days ago"
git log --since="2.weeks" --until "3.days"

branches
=-=-=-=-=
show branches
git branch

create branch
git branch new_feature

switch branch
git checkout new_feature

stitch back to master
git checkout master

create branch and checkout
git checkout -b second_branch

show all details in all branches
git log --graph --decorate --all --oneline

compare branches
git diff master..second_branch
different formatting
git diff --color-words master..second_branch

to see which commits are in branch
switch to branch and run
git branch --merged
will show which branches have all their commits merged with this branch and hence those branches can be saftely deleted

rename branch
git branch -m new_feature first_branch

delete branch
git branch -d test_branch
delete with changes
git branch -D test_branch

Change command prompt
echo $PS1

Save in notepad file .bash_profile in ~ folder
export PS1='\w$(__git_ps1 "(%s)") >'

merging branch
switch to branch which "receives" the changes from branch
git checkout master
git merge second_branch
second_branch changes will be merged into master

stash - temporary storage
git stash save "stashed stuff"

show stuff in stash
git stash list
stash is available in all branches
git stash show -p stash@{0}

pull items out of stash
git stash pop stash@{0}
git stash apply stash@{0}
pop removes items from stash
apply leaves copy in stash
if do not specify stash@{x} then will pull stash@{0}

github
push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/sushil-sharma/cmds.git

push to remote
git push -u origin master
-u is to track changes

check remote
git remote -v

remove remote
git remote rm origin

see details
cat .git/config

see remote branches
git branch -r

see all branches
git branch -a

creates new branch origin/master
same as any other branch but we cannot checkout
origin is synced with remote server branch
we merge changes betwen our master branch and origin/master branch

clone existing repro
cd ..
chang edir to a folder which is not an exiting repro
git clone https://github.com/sushil-sharma/hello-friend.git
will create folder automatically

git commit -am "new change"
commits only to local repro - NOT remote

push changes
git push

git log --oneline


fetch changes by someone else
git fetch origin
or
git fetch
syncs remote and local origin branch - not local master
have to merge changes between local origin branch to local master
git merge origin/master

fetch before you work
fetch before you push
fetch often
fetch then merge then push

git pull = git fetch + git merge

checkout branch
git checkout -b branch1 origin/branch1

delete branch from remote
git push origin :branch1
or
git push origin --delete branch1

collaboration
add collaborator using github
collaborator makes a fork in github
then issues a pull request

alias
git config --global alias.st "status"
st = status
git st

git config --global alias.logg "log --graph --decorate --oneline --abbrev-commit --all"
git logg

see changes
cat ../../.gitconfig
